    "There are several modes in which a file can be opened in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' (Read Only): This is the default mode, and it opens the file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (Write Only): This mode opens the file for writing only. If the file already exists, its contents will be truncated (deleted). If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (Append Only): This mode opens the file for writing only, and it appends new data to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (Write Exclusive Creation): This mode is similar to 'w', but it fails if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (Binary Mode): This mode is used to open a binary file, such as an image or a binary data file. This mode is usually used in combination with other modes, such as 'rb' for reading a binary file, or 'wb' for writing a binary file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'+' (Read and Write): This mode opens the file for reading and writing. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file."

    "The close() function is used to close an open file in Python. It is important to close a file after you are done with it because it frees up resources and ensures that the data you have written to the file is saved to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a file is open, Python reserves a certain amount of memory and system resources for the file object. If you open too many files at once or keep files open for an extended period of time, you can run out of memory or other resources on your computer. Closing the file releases these resources and allows other parts of your program to use them.\n",

    "In addition, if you don't close a file after writing to it, there is a risk that the data you have written to the file may not be saved. The operating system may write data to disk in an unpredictable manner, so it's important to close a file after writing to\n"
