    "Abstraction is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows developers to focus on the essential features of an object, ignoring any non-essential details. It helps to simplify complex systems by hiding their underlying implementation details and exposing only the essential characteristics and behavior of the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a car. When we talk about a car, we don't need to know how the engine works or how the transmission system functions. All we care about is the car's ability to start, drive, and stop. These are the essential features of the car, and they are what we want to abstract away from the underlying implementation details.\n",
